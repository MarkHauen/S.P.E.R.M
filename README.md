The Secure Password Encryption Registy Manager (S.P.E.R.M) can be used to generate, encrypt, and retrieve
cryptographically secure passwords. On first use, enter a Master Password and click 'Unlock'. This will
create a data file in appdata/local with an encrypted entry for the Master Password. Create a new password
by filling in the Password Label and clicking 'Get Password'. Get an existing password by choosing from the 
drop down or manually filling in the Password Label and click 'Get Password'. The password will display and
automatically be copied to the clipboard.
